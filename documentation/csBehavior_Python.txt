getFeatureProb:

This takes a probablity dictionary as an argument. It will itterate through the entry 'varsToUse' in the dictionary and generate values for each of those variables to use across a set of trials. The number of trials to compute are defined in the dictionary. 

All probabilities are generated by splitting 100% of the trials across the following probability concepts in order:
1) yourVariable_min
2) yourVariable_max
3) yourVariable_steps

The probabilites it will use for each are defined in the dictionary using the following schemne:
yourVariable_probs = [minProb,maxProb]
The step probability is infered as whatever is left. 

To define these more clearly:
yourVariable_min: A minumum value you want your variable distribution to have.
yourVariable_max: Same, but the max value of the distribution.
yourVariable_steps: This is a single, series, or range of values that you want in addiiton to the min and max.
